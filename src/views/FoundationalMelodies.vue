         target="_blank">&quot;heads&quot;</a>. There should be
      a motor-like quality to the rhythmic fabric spun in these compositions. Most commonly the rhythmic unit
      is referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_note" target="_blank"> 8th note </a>
      (swinging 8th note in most cases), that’s the motor to which I’m referring.
      The principal idea is based is generating a personal, comfortable rhythmic feel within the melodic/harmonic
      framework of the language.

    <h1>Foundational Melodies: A philosophy for the development of a jazz musician - <cite>Michael Kramer</cite></h1>
    <article>
      <h2 id="melody-harmony">Melody and Harmony</h2>
      <p class="rotation">It’s my personal philosophy that <strong>melody and harmony</strong> are of the same fabric.
        <strong>Like space and time.</strong></p>
      <p> I love the analogy of space and time because in physics these are described as a fabric,
        a continuum. As humans, we experience these separately but that is our limited ability to
        experience the vast range of scale encompassed in the phrase &quot;to be&quot;. The addition of a
        massive body at a point in space, something like a planet or a star, bends surrounding space.
        There are two consequences of this: firstly, objects traveling in space follow the curvature of
        that space - this is one way to describe the force of gravity, the apple fell on Newtons head
        because it broke free from its branch and moved along the curvature of space until it was
        interrupted by Newtons head. Secondly, the apple’s experience of time changes relative to the
        extent of which the gravitational force is being exerted upon it. The closer it is to the earth
        the stronger the earth’s gravitational field is acting on the apple, the slower the apple
        experiences time <strong>RELATIVE</strong> to the apples still on the tree, further away from the mass exerting
        the force, the earth.</p>

      <aside><small><b>As an interesting sidebar let’s briefly note that the forces of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration" target="_blank">acceleration</a> and
        gravity are one and the same. So an apple within a spaceship rocketing out of the earth’s atmosphere
        at an alarming rate of acceleration is experiencing the same force as the apple that falls from the
        tree.</b></small></aside>

      <h2 id="imagery">Imagery</h2>

      <p class="rotation"><em>What does this have to do with Charlie Parker?</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The notes comprising the harmony of the moment are the massive objects scattered throughout space,
          bending its shape, like the planets and star of a solar system.
        </li>
        <li>
          The notes of a melodic line are comets soaring through a planetary system coming in and put of the
          gravitational pull of planets in their trajectory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rhythmic feel is embodied by the aggregate of these individual relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s an imperfect analogy, yet it remains one of the most inspiring images I can relax into to get
          into a <b>flow state</b> while improvising. After all, the study of these melodies in learning to generate
          a comfortable and personal rhythmic feel is to the end of developing one’s voice as an improviser.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="flow">Develop your own imagery - Fall into flow</h2>
        <em>Certainly different people conceptualize, visualize, imagine, and hear in their minds' ear
          in different ways - consequently, this thought might not be helpful to some, yet I’d still
          like to offer:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cultivate your own imagery for the intersection of harmony, melody and rhythm. The above
          remains the most powerful for me (the gravity image), however its root in my imagination
          probably stems from a lesson I had in college with my teacher
          <a href="https://music.umd.edu/directory/gerard-kunkel" target="_blank">Gerry Kunkel</a>. First,
          he had me go to a white board and make an “interesting” visual composition with only triangles.
          There were no rules, they could intersect, have any angle structure (acute, obtuse, right).
          I spent maybe five minutes on my drawing and when I was done he asked me to play the drawing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I don’t remember the tune we played, and can’t recall if I had been struggling with it
          previously, but I strongly recall the feeling of liberation in &quot;playing the drawing&quot;.
          It was not a literal thing, it was the imagery of a geometric world in 2 dimensional space,
          these intersecting triangles that opened up all sorts of musical gestures and thoughts
          spontaneously that I was discovering in my mind in the split second before playing them.
          And the heaviest thing about it was that the part of
          <a href="https://youtu.be/H_HEyzkycro" target="_blank">“making the changes”</a> seemed to be
          taking care of itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          I recall before this experience being rather frustrated with the process of transcribing and
          assimilating the fruits of those transcriptions as I had not yet learned to go beyond taking
          the transcribed line literally based on its original context. I was still in a place of
          &quot;plugging &quot; lines into other harmonic contexts that happened to fit. This process for me was
          the antithesis of flow. On one hand, I was in love with doing the work yet on the other hand
          I knew there was an ingredient missing in the process for creating my own melodies
          spontaneously beyond the analysis and assimilation of syntax through transcription.
        </li>
        <li>
          The triangle imagery experience was my introduction to that missing ingredient and sparked
          the beginning of what has helped me achieve my flow state in the context of an improvised performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Although it’s certainly important to deal with complete melodies, I highly recommend dealing with
        individual phrases and <strong>transposing these phrases.</strong> There is a certain dichotomy in understanding
        these foundational melodies as both complete compositions and a complete set of individual phrases
        that can be manipulated in study, practice and performance outside their greater original context.
