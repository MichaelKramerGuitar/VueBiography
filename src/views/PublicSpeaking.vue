      <h2 id="intro">Introduction: The Importance of Financial Aid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My mother, an art teacher with a passion for alternative education put 100% of her income into
          WWS, the solution my parents worked out to make it possible for me to attend
        </li>
        <li>
          I still would not have been able to attend this school for 12 years without financial aid –
          <strong>EVERY YEAR</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Has to get a job for high school years and contribute from my income towards my education
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><i>Still rely heavily on financial aid to send my own children</i></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          What makes your contribution to the community financial aid pot worthwhile?
        </li>
        <li>
          My family’s example suggests it facilitates more equitable access to the following…
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="head-hand-heart">Head, Hand, Heart</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What makes this community special is the attendance to the Head, Hand and Heart throughout
          each developmental stage
        </li>
        <li>This philosophy balances the educational approach from the nursery years through the
          high school years
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong>
          where the <strong>lead teachers</strong> help both <strong>children and parents </strong> find a
          healthy balance
        </li>
        <li>
          The emphasis here is on the <strong>development of capacities for learning grounded in bodily experience
          and soaked in empathy</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Developing learning capacity is to learn <strong>how to think, not what to think.</strong> The child’s
          head, hand and heart are shaped together as a creative empty vessel, rather than assuming the
          child’s mind is already an empty vessel waiting to be filled with “useful” information
        </li>
        <li>
          I consider how different the world was when I started grade school in the late 90s from the
          time I graduated from high school in 2007 from now and am grateful for the emphasis on capacity
          development over a benchmark approach to education – and further wish this for my children
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><i>The endgame is to be able to parse, interpret and internalize interdisciplinary abstract
            concepts including concepts that do not currently exist to make informed decisions in
            the world as an adult</i></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="conceptual-metaphor">Conceptual Metaphor makes abstract though possible</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented at Waldorf through Fables, Mythology, stories and folded into early childhood
          education loading the slingshot into young adulthood academic rigor
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Any one thing can only be understood in terms of another thing</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately that understanding must come down to something that is experienced in the body,
          the necessary context for all human experience – <i>keep in mind the Head, Hand, Heart</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Let’s consider <strong>language as the parent abstraction</strong> and the
          <strong>academic disciplines being implementations of specific communicative approaches</strong>,
          lenses or angles for examining the world.
          For example, studying History is a way to learn about the world such that we can communicate
          about the world through that lens
        </li>
        <li>
          At any developmental stage, language in this way is not a procedure, algorithm or set of
          rules/facts rather an <strong>EMBODIED</strong> skill all with origins lying in the
          <strong>EMPATHIC COMMUNICATION</strong>of music where they are deeply connected with the body
        </li>

          The talking drum tradition stems from Sub-Saharan Africa
        </li>
        <li>
          Detailed messages can be communicated over long distances
        </li>
        <li>
          This drum language is <strong>not an attempt to mimic sound patterns of words or phrases</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><i>Reception is rather a visualization of the movements of the drummer and experiencing what
            the drummer is experiencing through imaginatively inhabiting the body of the drummer</i></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="empathic-imitation">Empathic Imitation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Children grasp concepts holistically through imitation, not to be confused with copying by wrote
        </li>
        <li>
          Rather, driven by a feeling of attraction resulting from a mysterious process of a <strong>will to
          apprehend “a whole” by inhabiting the subjects’ body and experience.</strong> Imagine the circle time of
          the children’s garden with the movement, songs and stories – which abstracts further as the
          child ages into sitting at a desk and learning topics more “traditionally” and reflecting
          through creative (handwork, woodwork, art) projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><i>This is Empathic Imitation</i></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, through this, values can be developed which collectively form identity
        </li>
        <li>
          This leads us to the importance of attention itself…
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="attention-moral">Attention is a moral act: A reciprocal process with consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We pay attention differently to a man dying before our eyes than to a sunset. To a doctor,
          the dying man might be a case study of a pathology – but if this man is a loved one the attention
          is of a different nature. The sunset may be an everyday occurrence or a deep non-dualistic experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here we learn that the attention we pay to a thing determines what we find there
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What a thing is depends on who is attending to it and in what way</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><i>Attention has consequences</i></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Another way to express this: We neither invent a subjective reality nor do we discover an
          objective or intersubjective reality rather there is a process of responsive evocation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="responsive-evocation">Responsive Evocation: The Culminating Concept</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><i>The world calls forth something in me that in turn calls forth something in the world.</i></strong>
          This is the essence of creativity and the essence of learning in this community
        </li>
        <li>
          This is true of perceptive qualities which extend into academics
        </li>
        <li>
          The stoniness of the mountain is evoked through the chemistry of the subject and the one perceiving
          coming together and this <strong>qualitative experience equally depends on both parties</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION: We Are Transmitters, Not Originators: A Brief Story about the Titan of the Tenor Saxophone, Sonny Rollins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A jazz drummer was auditioning for Sonny’s band in the mid 2000’s when the repertoire was mostly
          Calypso, not jazz
        </li>
        <li>
          The audition started off rough but soon took a positive turn
        </li>
        <li>
          The drummer, striving to be able to reproduce the right, feel asks Sonny a technical question
          about his snare pattern
        </li>
        <li>
          Sonny pauses for an uncomfortably long time, and when he finally speaks he says:
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>&quot;You are here to receive information from your environment and make informed decisions
            based on that input - and if you consider this, it is a most privileged state of being&quot;</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>This story beautifully encapsulates responsive evocation</strong>, the culmination of what this
          community is cultivating in our children in preparation to make decisions in the world
        </li>
